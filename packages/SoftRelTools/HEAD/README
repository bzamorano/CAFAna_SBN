SRT has been stable for a long time, but we (on the NOvA experiment)
are beginning to have issues with certain linux configurations,
specifically SL6 Docker instances running on top of newer configurations.
We intend to commit a small fix which will allow SRT to determine the
linux version of the Docker instance instead of the underlying hardware.

If you are still using SRT and want to discuss this potential change
with us, please contact Alex Himmel at ahimmel@fnal.gov
