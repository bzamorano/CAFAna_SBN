The old SoftRelTools built libraries in a funny way. It didn't archive together
the files specified in the GNUmakefile. Instead it archived together all the .o
files it found in the appropriate subdirectory of tmp. The correct .o files
were put in that place by default. This approach has problems to numerous to
list. This "feature" has been used to make libraries out of several
subdirectories. If several different subdirectories all claim to make the same
library, the last time the library is made, it will have all the objects from
all the subdirectories.

This usage is highly deprecated. SoftRelTools 2 will only create libraries in
this way if the variable CATCHALL_LIBS is defined. (It is defined by default in
the SRT_CDF and SRT_D0 packages.) The example package BigLibs in the
SoftRelTools repository shows how a library with files in multiple source
directories can be built in an easier way. It can be built the old way if so
desired. To look at BigLib, do
    addpkg -d :pserver:anonymous@srtcvs.fnal.gov:/srtcvs -h BigLib
in a test release. If you have never checked anything out of srtcvs, you will
have to do
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@srtcvs.fnal.gov:/srtcvs login
and give "anoncvs" as the password.
