Instructions for using SoftRelTools with ups

I suggest setting up a default SoftRelTools product and an srt_release product.
There should be a separate version of srt_release for each base release. There
only need be a single SoftRelTools version declared to ups. The table files are
in the templates subdirectory of SoftRelTools. The SoftRelTools table file
should be usable as is. The srt_release table files needs some editing for local
preferences.

These table files remove the need for the boot release and the srt directory.
The boot release and srt directories still work, but they are no longer
necessary.

These table files will unsetup cleanly.

Step-by-step instructions for setting up SoftRelTools and srt_release products
follow.

Assumptions:

SRT_DIST 	is the location of your distribution.
HEAD 		is the default version.
UPSDB 		is your UPS database.
RELEASE 	is the name of your release

A. Declare a default version of SoftRelTools to ups: 

    1. cd SRT_DIST/packages/SoftRelTools/HEAD

    2. cp ../templates/SoftRelTools.table ups/SoftRelTools.table

    3. ups declare -d -z UPSDB -m SoftRelTools.table -f NULL -r
    SRT_DIST/packages/SoftRelTools/HEAD SoftRelTools HEAD 

    4. check:
	    ups list -a SoftRelTools

    5. ups declare -c SoftRelTools HEAD -f NULL

B. Declare your release to ups:

    1. cd SRT_DIST/releases/RELEASE
    
    2. mkdir ups
    
    3. cp SoftRelTools/templates/srt_release.table.example ups/srt_release.table
    
    4. Modify srt_release.table as necessary. You will need to set
    DEFAULT_CVSROOT, DEFAULT_SRT_CXX and DEFAULT_SRT_PROJECT. You may want to
    add other settings.
    
    5. ups declare -d -z UPSDB -m srt_release.table -f NULL -r `pwd` srt_release
    RELEASE

    6. check:
    	ups list -a srt_release


Now
	setup srt_release RELEASE
will set up SoftRelTools using base release RELEASE.
