Quickstart:

	Type "srt_super_init" in the top-level directory of a test release.
	Type "srt_setup -aS" to use the super feature.
	
Long description:

SoftRelTools now supports the concept of a "super" test release. A super test
release contains soft links to the base release for everything that is not
explicitly included in the test release.
	"Everything" means:
		1) include areas
		2) tmp areas
		3) All package products. The package products are determined by the
		SoftRelTools variable SRT_PRODUCTS, which by default includes all
		binaries, libraries, object files in the library directory, and
		installed documentation. The variables SRT_PRODUCTS can be added to as
		needed.

When the super option is set in srt_setup, the base release will no longer be in
the include path of any SoftRelTools operations. This solves the "header file
deleted in the test release, but still present in the base release" problem.

To prepare a test release for super use, type
	srt_super_init
in the top-level directory of a test release.

The super directory will only be used if srt_setup has been called with the
--Super (-S) option. ***You must also include the --auto-local (-a) option.***
This can be checked by looking at the output of srt_environment. You should see
the line 
	SRT_SUPER = "true"

When SRT_SUPER is set, the super directory will add new links to the base
release if the base release changes. Unfortunately, it will not *remove* links
to the base release. When in doubt, type
	gmake super_refresh
and the super directory will be rebuilt on the next gmake.

Caveat: The super directory will always contain links to the base release for
SoftRelTools and SRT_$PROJECT directories, even if they are present in the test
release. On the rare occasion that one of these packages needs "the super
treatment" the links should be adjusted by hand.
